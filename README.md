# ButtonRemap
A repository for handy AutoHotKey scripts

## zoom_mapper.ahk
This configures your play/pause button to keypress **_"Alt + A"_** which is Zoom's mute/unmute shortcut.
(The play/pause button is generally the standard answer button on bluetooth headsets)

For best results, Alt + A should map to zoom even when zoom app is not in focus. To achieve this:
> Zoom > Settings > Keyboard Shortcuts > Mute/Unmute My Audio > Alt + A (already set) > Enable Global Shortcut
