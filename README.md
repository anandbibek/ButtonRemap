## zoom_mapper.ahk

If you're using a bluetooth headset that can play and pause music but you are not able to mute/unmute yourselves during Zoom meetings, then look no further. ðŸ¤—

This configures your play/pause button to keypress **_"Alt + A"_** which is Zoom's mute/unmute shortcut.
(The play/pause button is generally the standard answer button on bluetooth headsets)

For best results, Alt + A should map to zoom even when zoom app is not in focus. To achieve this:
> Zoom > Settings > Keyboard Shortcuts > Mute/Unmute My Audio > Alt + A (already set) > Enable Global Shortcut âœ”
